### Problem Section (The Pain)

**Section Heading:**
```
Sound Familiar?
```

**Problem Bullet Points:**
- Client feedback scattered across email, Slack, phone calls, and annotated PDFs
- "Which version is final?" confusion with endless file sharing links
- Constant "what's the status?" inquiries from clients
- Juggling 10+ tools just to manage client communication
- Important feedback falling through the cracks
- Clients refusing to adopt complex project management systems

**Empathy Statement:**
```
You didn't start your agency to spend hours organizing files and chasing feedback. You started it to do great work.
```

### FAQ Section

**Section Heading:**
```
Frequently Asked Questions
```

**Q: How is this different from project management tools like Asana or Monday?**
```
A: Those tools are great for internal team management, but they're complex and clunky for client communication. We're the client-facing layer—simple, branded, and focused on files, feedback, and visibility. Your team can keep using Asana internally; we make the client part effortless.
```

**Q: Do my clients need to create an account?**
```
A: Nope! That's the point. Just send them a link and they can access files, leave feedback, and check project status immediately. No signup, no passwords to remember, no friction.
```

**Q: What file types can I upload?**
```
A: PDFs, images (PNG, JPG, etc.), design files (Figma links, Sketch), documents (Word, Google Docs links), video files—basically anything you need to share with clients.
```

**Q: Is my data secure?**
```
A: Absolutely. All files are encrypted in transit and at rest. We use enterprise-grade cloud storage and follow security best practices. Your client work is safe.
```

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
```
A: Yes. Month-to-month, no contracts, no cancellation fees. If it's not saving you time, we don't deserve your money.
```

**Q: When will the beta launch?**
```
A: We're onboarding beta users now. Join the waitlist and we'll send you early access within 2-4 weeks.

## Notes for Next Iteration

The landing page is the critical validation checkpoint. This determines whether we proceed to building the MVP or need to pivot.

**Key principles:**
1. **Speed > Perfection** - Launch in 1 day, iterate based on data
2. **Talk to customers** - Every signup is a potential customer discovery call
3. **Measure what matters** - Email signups and engagement quality > vanity metrics
4. **Be ready to pivot** - If the market says no, listen and adjust

**Remember:** The goal isn't to get thousands of signups. The goal is to validate that people care enough to give us their email and, ideally, their time for a conversation.

---

**Status:** ✅ Landing page copy complete
**Next Action:** Build landing page in Carrd.co
**Owner:** Marketing lead or founder
**Timeline:** Launch within 48 hours
