## Problem Section

### Headline: The Hidden Cost of AI Tool Overload

**Subheadline:**
You're not alone. 90% of small businesses are drowning in AI subscriptions they barely use.

**3-Column Layout:**

**Column 1: Subscription Fatigue**
- 50+ different AI tools on the market
- Average SMB uses 10-15 AI subscriptions
- 30-40% of AI spend is wasted on unused tools
- Multiple logins, dashboards, and invoices to manage

**Column 2: Implementation Struggles**
- Most AI tools require technical expertise
- "DIY" platforms leave you stuck in setup mode
- Tools sit unused while subscriptions keep billing
- No clear workflow or support structure

**Column 3: Bill Shock**
- Usage-based pricing creates unpredictable costs
- One automation spike = $500+ Zapier bill
- No visibility into which tools drive ROI
- Scaling requires hiring expensive developers

**Supporting Quote:**
*"I was paying $400/month across 7 AI tools, but only using 3 consistently. The rest sat there while I kept getting billed. This platform replaced everything for $99/month."* — Sarah K., Marketing Agency Owner

**Pain Point Checklist:**
- [ ] Tired of managing 10+ subscriptions?
- [ ] Frustrated by unpredictable monthly bills?
- [ ] Overwhelmed by technical setup requirements?
- [ ] Watching AI tools go unused while paying for them?
- [ ] Ready to consolidate but don't know where to start?
