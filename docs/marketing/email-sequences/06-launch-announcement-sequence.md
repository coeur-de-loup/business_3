## Email 3: Launch Day +4 - Feature Highlight

**Subject:** 3 features you probably missed 🎯

**Preheader:** Drag-and-drop builder, brand voice training, concierge onboarding

**Body:**

{{first_name}},

**You've probably seen the main features.**

But there are 3 hidden gems that most users miss (and love once they discover them).

---

### 💎 Hidden Gem #1: Drag-and-Drop Workflow Builder

**The Problem:** Most automation tools are confusing and technical.

**Our Solution:**

Visual builder that feels like connecting Lego blocks.

- Drag a "trigger" (e.g., "new email received")
- Drag an "action" (e.g., "generate AI response")
- Connect them with a line
- Click "Run"

**Result:** Anyone can build automations. Not just "tech people."

**Real Example:**
Lisa (e-commerce, zero technical skills) built her first workflow in 12 minutes.
"I'm not techy at all. If I can do this, anyone can."

[Try the Drag-and-Drop Builder]

---

### 💎 Hidden Gem #2: Brand Voice Training

**The Problem:** AI outputs sound robotic. You spend more time editing than the AI saved you.

**Our Solution:**

Train our AI on your brand voice once. It remembers forever.

1. Upload 5-10 pieces of your content (blog posts, emails, social media)
2. Our AI analyzes your tone, style, vocabulary
3. All future outputs match your voice automatically

**Result:** Less editing. More consistency. Better outputs.

**Time Investment:** 10 minutes one-time
**ROI:** Every AI output gets better, forever

[Train Your Brand Voice]

---

### 💎 Hidden Gem #3: Concierge Onboarding (First 100 Only)

**The Problem:** You sign up for tools, spend hours figuring them out, get frustrated, and quit.

**Our Solution:**

For our first 100 customers, we do it **with** you.

1. You sign up
2. Book a 15-minute onboarding call
3. We identify 3 workflows that will save you the most time
4. We build them together **on the call**
5. You walk away with working automations

**No more "figure it out yourself."**

**Status:** 67/100 spots taken
**Remaining:** 33 spots
