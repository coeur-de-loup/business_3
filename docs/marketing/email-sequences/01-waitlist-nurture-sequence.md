## Email 2: The Problem (Send Day 3)

**Subject:** The $300/month mistake most businesses make

**Preheader:** You're probably wasting 30-40% of your AI tool budget. Here's the fix.

**Body:**

{{first_name}},

Quick question: How many AI subscriptions are you paying for right now?

5? 10? 15?

**Here's the scary part:** Most small businesses use only 3-5 of them consistently. The rest? Wasted money.

**The Math:**
- Average SMB pays for: 12 AI subscriptions
- Average SMB actually uses: 4 consistently
- Wasted monthly spend: $300-500
- **Annual waste: $3,600-6,000** 💸

**The 3 Hidden Costs of AI Tool Overload:**

1. **Subscription Fatigue** - Multiple invoices, multiple logins, multiple headaches
2. **Implementation Friction** - Tools sit unused because setup is too technical
3. **Context Switching** - Lost productivity jumping between 10 different dashboards

**Our Solution:**

One platform. One login. One invoice.

Replace 10 AI tools with 1 unified platform. Setup in 15 minutes. Save $200-500/month.

**Want to see how much you could save?**

## Email 5: Feature Preview (Send Day 12)

**Subject:** Peek behind the curtain: 3 features we're obsessed with

**Preheader:** From drag-and-drop workflows to concierge onboarding (sneak peek inside)

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Launch is in 3 days, and we wanted to give you a sneak peek at what we've been building.

**Here are the 3 features our beta users love most:**

---

### 1️⃣ Drag-and-Drop Workflow Builder

**The Problem:** Most automation tools require coding or complex "if-this-then-that" logic that makes your brain hurt.

**Our Solution:**

Visual workflow builder that feels like assembling Lego blocks.

- Drag a "trigger" (e.g., "new email received")
- Drag an "action" (e.g., "generate AI response")
- Drag another "action" (e.g., "send to Slack")
- Connect them with lines
- Click "Run"

**Result:** Anyone on your team can build automations. Not just the "tech person."

---

### 2️⃣ Concierge Onboarding (First 100 Customers Only)

**The Problem:** You sign up for a tool, spend 2 hours figuring it out, get frustrated, and never use it again.

**Our Solution:**

For our first 100 customers, we do it **with** you.

1. You sign up
2. You book a 15-minute onboarding call
3. We identify 3 workflows that will save you the most time
4. We build them together **on the call**
5. You walk away with working automations

**No more "figure it out yourself."**

---

### 3️⃣ Brand Voice Memory

**The Problem:** AI outputs sound robotic and generic. You spend more time editing than the AI saved you in the first place.

**Our Solution:**

Train our AI on your brand voice once. It remembers forever.

- Upload your best blog posts, emails, and social media
- Our AI analyzes your tone, style, and vocabulary
- All future outputs match your brand voice automatically

**Result:** Less editing. More consistency. Better outputs.

---

**These features are why 94% of beta users said they'd recommend us.**

**2 days until we open access.** Ready?
