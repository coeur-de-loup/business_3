Hi {{first_name}},

You signed up yesterday. How's it going?

**If you haven't created your first workflow yet, you're not alone.**

40% of users don't create their first workflow until Day 2-3. That's totally normal.

---

### The 3 Most Common Questions We Get:

**Q1: "Which workflow should I start with?"**

A: The one that will save you the most time.

**Quick Exercise:**
1. What's the most repetitive task you do daily?
   - Email responses?
   - Social media posting?
   - Report generation?
   - Meeting prep?

2. Go to our template library
3. Search for that task
4. Click "Use Template"

We have 150+ templates. Odds are, we have one for your task.

## Email 3: Day 3 - Advanced Features (Send Day 3)

**Subject:** 3 features most users miss (but shouldn't)

**Preheader:** Unlock the full power of the platform (5 minutes read)

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

By now, you've hopefully created your first workflow. Nice work! 🎉

**But you're probably only using 20% of the platform's power.**

Here are 3 features that most users miss (but love once they discover them):

---

### Feature #1: Brand Voice Training ⭐

**The Problem:** AI outputs sound robotic and generic. You spend more time editing than the AI saved you.

**The Solution:**

1. Go to: Settings → Brand Voice
2. Upload 5-10 pieces of your best content
   - Blog posts
   - Emails
   - Social media posts
3. Our AI analyzes your tone, style, and vocabulary
4. All future outputs match your voice automatically

**Result:** Less editing. More consistency. Better outputs.

**Time Investment:** 10 minutes one-time
**ROI:** Every AI output gets better, forever

[Train Your Brand Voice Now]

---

### Feature #2: Workflow Chaining

**The Problem:** One automation is good. But what if you could chain multiple automations together?

**Example:**
1. Blog post published
2. ↓ (automatically triggers)
3. Generate 10 social media posts
4. ↓ (automatically triggers)
5. Post to Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook
6. ↓ (automatically triggers)
7. Add to analytics spreadsheet
8. ↓ (automatically triggers)
9. Send weekly report to your inbox

**This takes 5 minutes to build. Saves 2 hours/week.**

**How to Build It:**
1. Create each workflow separately
2. Use the "Chain Workflow" feature to link them
3. Set triggers (e.g., "after workflow X completes")

[Build Your First Workflow Chain]

---

### Feature #3: Scheduled Runs

**The Problem:** Some tasks need to happen on a schedule, not in real-time.

**Examples:**
- Weekly report generation (every Monday at 9 AM)
- Daily social media posting (3x per day)
- Monthly invoice reminders (1st of each month)

**How to Set It Up:**
1. Create your workflow
2. Click "Schedule Run"
3. Set your frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, custom)
4. Choose your time
5. Save

**Done.** Your workflow runs automatically, forever.

[Schedule Your First Workflow]

---

### 🎯 Your Goal for Today:

**Try one of these features.** Just one.

We recommend Brand Voice Training (10 minutes, one-time setup).

## Email 4: Day 7 - Success Story (Send Day 7)

**Subject:** How Sarah saved $420/month in 15 minutes

**Preheader:** Real case study: Marketing agency cuts 8 tools down to 1

**Body:**

{{first_name}},

I wanted to share a quick story about one of our users.

**Meet Sarah.**

She runs a marketing agency with 5 employees. Last month, she signed up for AI Orchestration.

**Her Situation (Before):**

- Paying for 12 different AI subscriptions
- Monthly AI spend: $480
- Her team only used 4 of them consistently
- Wasted time switching between tools
- No one else on her team knew how to use them

**What She Did:**

1. Signed up for AI Orchestration (15 minutes)
2. Booked a concierge onboarding call (15 minutes)
3. We built 3 workflows together on the call:
   - Auto-generate social media from blog posts
   - Auto-categorize and route client emails
   - Auto-generate weekly client reports

**Her Results (After 30 Days):**

- ✅ Cancelled 8 subscriptions, kept 4
- **Saved $420/month** ($5,040/year)
- **Saved 47 minutes/day** managing AI tools
- **Team adoption:** 100% (even non-technical staff)
- **ROI:** 384% in first month

**Her Team's Favorite Workflow:**

"We turn 1 blog post into 10 tweets, 3 LinkedIn posts, and 1 email newsletter in 2 minutes. Used to take us 2 hours."

---

### 🎯 Your Goal for This Week:

**Sarah's secret? She started with just ONE workflow.**

You don't need to build everything at once. Start with one workflow that will save you the most time.

**Quick Exercise:**
1. What task do you do repeatedly that you HATE?
2. Go to our template library
3. Search for that task
4. Click "Use Template"
5. Run it

**That's it.** One workflow. 15 minutes. Done.
