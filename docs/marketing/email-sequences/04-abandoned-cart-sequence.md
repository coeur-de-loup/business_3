### Let me make this simple:

2. How much time will you save? (multiply by $50/hour = monthly savings)

## Email 3: 72 Hours Later - Objection Handling

**Subject:** The 3 most common fears (and why they're wrong)

**Preheader:** "Too technical" "Too expensive" "Won't work for me" → Busted

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed you looked at our pricing 3 days ago but haven't started a trial yet.

**I get it.** Adopting new software is scary.

Let me address the 3 most common fears people have:

---

### Fear #1: "It's Too Technical"

**The Reality:**
- ✅ No coding required (zero, zip, nada)
- ✅ Drag-and-drop builder (like connecting Lego blocks)
- ✅ 150+ prebuilt templates (just click "Use This Template")
- ✅ We build your first 3 workflows WITH you (free onboarding)

**Real Example:**
Lisa (e-commerce owner, 8 employees) has zero technical skills.
She built her first workflow in 12 minutes.
"I'm not techy at all. If I can do this, anyone can."

---

### Fear #2: "It's Too Expensive"

**The Reality:**
- ✅ Most customers save $200-500/month
- ✅ Pays for itself in 4-6 weeks
- ✅ After that, it's pure profit

**Real Example:**
David (consultant, 3 employees) was paying $380/month for AI tools.
Switched to our $99/month plan.
**Saves $281/month. ROI: 284% in first month.**

**Break-even:** 11 days
**After that:** $281/month pure savings

---

### Fear #3: "It Won't Work for My Industry"

**The Reality:**
- ✅ We have templates for 50+ industries
- ✅ Marketing agencies, consulting, e-commerce, real estate, healthcare, legal, education...
- ✅ If we don't have your industry, we'll build custom workflows for you

**Real Examples:**
- **Marketing Agency:** Auto-generates social media from blog posts

---

### 🎯 The Truth:

**The only real risk is NOT trying it.**

## Email 4: 7 Days Later - Last Call

**Subject:** Still thinking about it? 🤔

**Preheader:** One last question before we close your file...

**Body:**

{{first_name}},

It's been a week since you checked out our pricing.

**I have one question:**

What's holding you back?

---

### Is it one of these?

**"I don't have time to learn another tool."**

Reality: Takes 15 minutes to set up. Saves 30-60 minutes/day.

---

**"I'm not sure it'll work for my specific needs."**

Reality: 150+ templates. If we don't have it, we'll build it.

---

**"I'm worried about the learning curve."**

Reality: No learning curve. Drag-and-drop. We onboard you for free.

---

**"Money's tight right now."**

Reality: Most customers save $200-500/month. Pays for itself in weeks.

---

**"I need to talk to my team/partner first."**

Reality: Fair! Reply to this email and I'll send you a PDF to share with them.

---

### 💡 Here's What I Think:

**You're interested.** Otherwise you wouldn't have looked at pricing.

**You're cautious.** Smart. You should be.

**But you're overthinking it.** It's a 14-day free trial. No risk. No credit card.

---

### 🎯 My Advice:

**Just try it.**

Worst case: You waste 15 minutes, confirm it's not for you, cancel.

Best case: You save $200-500/month and 30-60 minutes/day.

**Risk: $0 and 15 minutes**
**Reward: $3,000-6,000/year and hundreds of hours**

**Those are good odds.**

---

### ⏰ This is my last email about this.

I don't want to be annoying. But I also don't want you to miss out on $300-500/month in savings.

**The ball's in your court.**
