### 💡 The "Aha!" Moment

Most users hit their "aha!" moment around Day 7-10.

It's that moment when you realize: **"Wow, this actually works."**

Maybe it's when:
- You wake up to find 10 social media posts auto-generated from your blog
- Your inbox is empty because common emails were auto-answered
- A weekly report appears in your inbox without you lifting a finger

**If you haven't had your "aha!" moment yet, you will.**

Just keep building. It clicks.

---

### 🚀 Advanced Challenge for This Week:

**Build a workflow chain.**

Connect 2-3 workflows together so one triggers another.

**Example:**
