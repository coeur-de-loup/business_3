**Date:** January 9, 2026
**Status:** Draft - Based on Validated Pain Points
**Next Review:** After 50 customer interviews

---

## Executive Summary

**Pricing Philosophy:** Premium but accessible pricing that reflects the value of saving 10-20 hours/week in communication chaos, while remaining affordable for 3-20 employee agencies.

**Core Pricing Strategy:**
- **Starter:** $29/month (1-3 active clients, core features)
- **Professional:** $79/month (5-25 active clients, advanced features)
- **Agency:** $149/month (25-100+ active clients, full features)

## 2. Pricing Strategy Rationale

### Why This Pricing Structure?

**1. Tiered by Client Count, Not Team Size:**
- Problem: Per-user pricing penalizes agencies for growing their team
- Solution: Flat pricing based on client portals (revenue-generating capacity)
- Benefit: Predictable costs, agencies can grow team without price increases
- Exception: Professional tier includes 2-5 team members (most small agencies)

**2. Value-Based Pricing:**
- Competitors: Charge for features, storage, users
- Us: Charge for outcomes (time saved, organization, professionalism)
- Evidence: Agencies already losing $500-2,000/month in billable time to communication chaos
- Our price: $29-149 (4-18x less than the cost of the problem)

**3. Psychological Pricing:**
- $29 (not $30): Feels like "under $30"
- $79 (not $80): Just under psychological barrier
- $149 (not $150): Feels significantly cheaper than $150-200 range
- All end in "9": Classic pricing psychology (perceived as better value)

**4. Anchoring Effect:**
- Agency tier at $149 makes Professional at $79 seem like a bargain
- Professional tier highlighted as "Most Popular" (decoy effect)
- Expected mix: 40% Starter, 50% Professional, 10% Agency

**5. Transparent Pricing:**
- No "contact sales for pricing" (all prices visible)
- No hidden fees or usage limits (within tier)
- No per-user pricing (team pricing)
- Display pricing prominently on website
- Clear comparison table (features vs. limitations)

### Competitive Pricing Analysis

| Competitor | Pricing Model | Monthly Cost | Our Advantage |
|------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Basecamp** | Flat ($11/user) | $11-99+ | We're 2.7x more expensive but offer white-label + agency focus |
| **Asana** | Per-user ($10.99+) | $10.99-30.99/user | We're flat pricing (no per-user penalty), simpler for clients |
| **Monday.com** | Per-user ($8+) | $8-24/user | We're focused on agency-client workflow, not generic PM |
| **Moxo** | Per-user ($15+) | $200-500+ | We're 40-70% cheaper, simpler, agency-focused |
| **SuiteDash** | Flat ($29-97) | $29-97 | Similar pricing, but we're simpler and more focused |
| **Agency Handy** | Flat ($47-197) | $47-197 | Competitive, but we emphasize email notifications + simplicity |
| **Google Drive + Email** | Free/$12 | $0-12 | We eliminate communication chaos, not just file storage |

**Our Sweet Spot:**
- Too expensive for freelancers on tight budget ($11-20 tools)
- Too cheap for enterprises ($200+/month tools)
- **Perfect for 3-20 employee agencies ($29-149/month)**

**Why We Can Charge More Than Basecamp:**
- Basecamp: Generic project management, no white-label, clients resist adopting
- Us: Agency-client communication focused, white-label branded portal, email notifications drive adoption
- Different use case: We're not "another project management tool" - we're "client communication hub"

**Why We're Cheaper Than Moxo:**
- Moxo: Enterprise features, complex, $200+/month
- Us: Simpler, agency-focused, solo-friendly, $79-149/month
- Target customer: 3-20 employee agencies can't afford Moxo

## 3. Pricing Psychology & Framing

### Value-Based Framing

**Don't Say:**
- "Our platform costs $79/month"

**Do Say:**
- "Save 15 hours/week × $75/hour = $1,125/month value for $79 investment"
- "ROI within 30 days: Replace scattered communication chaos with organized portal"
- "Stop losing $500-2,000/month in billable time to email and Slack chaos"
- "Look professional, save time, reduce stress - for less than $3/day"

### Price Anchoring

**Technique:** Show cost of problem first, then solution seems cheap

**Example:**
- "Agencies lose 10-20 hours/week to communication chaos"
- "At $75/hour, that's $750-1,500/month in wasted billable time"
- "Our solution: $79/month (5-10% of the cost of the problem)"

### Decoy Effect

**Technique:** Add a "decoy" tier to make preferred tier seem like best value

**Example:**
- Starter: $29/month (3 portals) ← Makes Professional seem expensive
- Professional: $79/month (25 portals) ← Highlighted as "Most Popular"
- Agency: $149/month (unlimited) ← Makes Professional seem like bargain

**Result:** Most customers choose Professional (our highest-volume tier)

### Loss Aversion

**Technique:** Frame price as avoiding loss, not gaining benefit

**Example:**
- "Stop losing clients due to disorganized communication" (loss)
- vs. "Improve client communication with our portal" (gain)
- Loss framing 2x more effective (behavioral economics research)

---

## 4. Monetization Experiments & Optimization

### Initial Pricing (Months 1-6): Validation Phase

**Goal:** Confirm willingness to pay at target price points

**Experiment 1: Price Anchoring on Website**
- Show all 3 tiers on pricing page
- Highlight Professional tier as "Most Popular"
- Add "Limited time: 20% off for life" for first 50 customers
- Expected conversion: 40% Starter, 50% Professional, 10% Agency

**Experiment 2: Annual Discount (Test Churn Impact)**
- Offer 20% discount for annual payment
- $29/month → $23.20/month ($278/year)
- $79/month → $63.20/month ($758/year)
- $149/month → $119.20/month ($1,430/year)
- Goal: 20-30% of customers choose annual (improves cash flow, reduces churn)

**Experiment 3: Free Trial vs. No Free Trial**
- **Option A:** 14-day free trial, credit card required (current plan)
- **Option B:** No free trial, 30-day money-back guarantee
- Test both, measure conversion and quality
- Hypothesis: Money-back guarantee attracts higher-quality customers (fewer tire-kickers)

### Pricing Optimization (Months 6-12): Data-Driven Adjustments

**Metric 1: Trial-to-Paid Conversion**
- Target: 20-30% conversion
- If <15%: Price too high or value not clear enough
- If >40%: Price too low, leaving money on table

**Metric 2: Tier Selection**
- Expected: 40% Starter, 50% Professional, 10% Agency
- If 70%+ Starter: Professional tier underpriced or not enough value, add more features
- If 30%+ Agency: Agency tier underpriced, raise to $179-199
- If 60%+ Professional: Starter tier underpriced, raise to $39

**Metric 3: Churn by Tier**
- Target: <3-5% monthly churn across all tiers
- If Starter churn >7%: Not enough value, add features or lower price to $24
- If Agency churn >7%: Support issues or product gaps, improve onboarding

**Metric 4: Price Objections**
- Track sales calls and support tickets
- If >40% mention price: Test lower tier ($24/month Starter)
- If <15% mention price: Room to raise prices 10-20%

### Pricing Experiments to Test (Months 6-12)

**Experiment 4: Lower Entry Tier**
- Add "Micro" tier at $19/month
- 1 client portal, 1GB storage, solo only
- Target: Very small freelancers (1-2 clients)
- Risk: Cannibalizes Starter tier, reduces ARPC

**Experiment 5: Raise Starter Tier**
- Increase Starter from $29 to $39/month
- Add more features (5 portals, 10GB storage, basic templates)
- Test if customers still convert (tests price sensitivity)
- Opportunity: Increase ARPC by $10/month across 40% of customers

**Experiment 6: Usage-Based Overage**
- Charge for additional client portals beyond tier limits
- Starter: +$10/month per additional portal (beyond 3)
- Professional: +$5/month per additional portal (beyond 25)
- Benefit: Monetize heavy users without tier upgrades

**Experiment 7: Add-On Pricing**
- Offer add-ons instead of tier upgrades
- +$20/month for custom domain (Starter tier)
- +$30/month for unlimited team members (Starter tier)
- +$50/month for priority support (any tier)
- Benefit: More granular pricing, higher ARPC

## 5. Discount & Promotional Strategy

### Launch Promotions (Months 1-3)

**Promotion 1: Founding Member Discount**
- **Offer:** 20% off for life
- **Limit:** First 50 customers
- **Goal:** Build initial customer base, generate testimonials, prove product-market fit
- **Expected Uptake:** 30-40% of early customers
- **Long-Term Impact:** Reduces ARPC by 8-12% (acceptable for early traction)

**Promotion 2: Annual Bonus (Test Churn Reduction)**
- **Offer:** Buy annual, get 2 months free (17% discount)
- **Alternative:** 20% discount for annual
- **Limit:** Unlimited
- **Goal:** Improve cash flow, reduce churn (annual customers stick longer)
- **Expected Uptake:** 15-25% of customers
- **Long-Term Impact:** Reduces churn by 30-50% for annual customers

**Promotion 3: Referral Program**
- **Offer:** Get 1 month free for each referral who becomes paying customer
- **Limit:** Unlimited (can stack up to 12 months free, then cap)
- **Goal:** Viral growth, reduce CAC
- **Expected Impact:** 10-20% of new customers from referrals (months 6-12)

**Promotion 4: Money-Back Guarantee**
- **Offer:** 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked
- **Limit:** First 90 days
- **Goal:** Reduce risk for early adopters, build trust
- **Expected Impact:** Increase trial-to-paid conversion by 5-10%

### Ongoing Discount Strategy

**Discount Policy:**
- **Never discount monthly pricing** (devalues product, creates price Hagglers)
- **Only discount annual pricing** (aligns incentives, locks in commitment)
- **Max discount: 20%** (preserves perceived value)
- **No custom discounts** (except for large agency deals - 50+ employees)

**When to Offer Discounts:**
- ✅ Annual contracts (20% off)
- ✅ Non-profit organizations (20% off)
- ✅ Long-term contracts (2+ years, 25% off)
- ❌ One-month discounts (creates expectation)
- ❌ "Just for you" discounts (hard to scale)
- ❌ Competitor matching (race to bottom)

**Agency Deal Structuring (Custom Pricing):**
For larger agencies (50+ employees) who want custom pricing:
- Start at $149/month base
- Add $50-100/month per additional 100 client portals (if unlimited not needed)
- Offer 20% discount for annual payment
- Offer 10% discount for 2-year commitment
- Minimum commitment: 12 months

3. **Highlight "Most Popular"** (decoy effect - Professional tier)
4. **Use clear language** (no jargon, no "contact us")
5. **Show value, not features** (outcomes: time saved, not inputs: file storage)
6. **Add social proof** (customer logos, testimonials as they come in)
7. **Offer free trial** (reduce risk, 14 days to experience value)

### Sales Scripts & Objections

**Common Price Objections:**

**Objection 1: "That's expensive compared to Basecamp ($11/month)"**
- **Response:** "Basecamp is great for internal team project management, but it's not built for agency-client communication. Clients resist adopting another complex tool. Our portal is white-labeled (looks like YOUR brand), simple for clients to use (email notifications bring them back), and focused specifically on agency-client workflows. Most agencies save 10-20 hours/week in communication chaos - that's $750-1,500 in recovered billable time for a $79 investment."

**Objection 2: "Can't you do $49/month for Professional?"**
- **Response:** "I appreciate you asking, but we keep pricing simple and fair for all customers. At $79/month, you're getting unlimited team member access (not per-user pricing like Asana), 25 client portals, advanced workflows, and priority support. Most customers tell us they save 15+ hours in the first month alone - that's $1,125+ in recovered billable time. The ROI is typically within 30 days. Is the $79/month the main concern, or would you like to start with a 14-day free trial to see the value first?"

**Objection 3: "I'll wait until you have a cheaper plan"**
- **Response:** "We do have a Starter tier at $29/month for 1-3 client portals - that might work if you're just getting started. But if you're managing 5+ clients and have a team, Professional pays for itself in the first month from time savings alone. Plus, we're offering 20% off for life for our first 50 customers - that brings Professional down to $63/month. Would you like to lock in that founding member rate?"

**Objection 4: "Why should I pay if Google Drive + Email is free?"**
- **Response:** "Google Drive is great for file storage, and email is essential - I'm not suggesting you replace those. The problem is fragmentation: Your client communication is scattered across 50 email threads, Slack messages, phone calls, and Google Drive links. Our portal consolidates all of that into ONE branded hub. No more 'I never saw that email' or 'Which version is final?' Most agencies tell us they save 10-20 hours/week just from having everything in one place. That's $750-1,500 in recovered billable time for a $29-79 investment. Would a 14-day free trial help you see if it saves you time?"

**Objection 5: "I'm not sure my clients will use another tool"**
- **Response:** "That's a valid concern - most of our customers said the same thing. Here's why clients DO use our portal: (1) Email notifications - clients get an email when you message or upload files, they click and land directly in the portal (no logging in to 'check'), (2) It's simpler than Slack or Asana - clients just view, comment, download, (3) It looks like YOUR brand (not another third-party tool), (4) It replaces chaos with order - clients appreciate having everything in one place instead of 50 scattered emails. Most agencies report 80-90% of clients actively using the portal within the first week. Want to try a free trial and test it with one client?"

- 80%+ customers select highest tier
- Customers say "this is a steal"

**Mitigation:**
- Increase prices by 10-20% across all tiers
- Add more features to justify higher price
- Introduce premium tier above current highest
- Reduce discounts (from 20% to 15%)
- Annualize pricing (push annual plans)

### Risk 3: Pricing Misalignment (Wrong Customer Mix)

**Signs:**
- 70%+ customers in Starter tier (not upgrading)
- <5% customers in Agency tier
- ARPC <target ($60-68)
- Customers hitting limits and churning

**Mitigation:**
- Add more features to Professional/Agency tiers (encourage upgrades)
- Reduce Starter tier features (3 portals → 2 portals)
- Improve upselling (in-app prompts: "You have 3 clients, upgrade to Professional")
- Introduce mid-tier between Starter and Professional
- Price anchor more effectively (highlight Professional value)

### Risk 4: Competitor Price War

**Signs:**
- Competitors lower prices (Basecamp, Moxo, SuiteDash)
- Competitors launch "agency" editions
- Customers mention competitor pricing
- Market price compression

**Mitigation:**
- Don't match prices (race to bottom, commoditization)
- Differentiate on value (simplicity, email notifications, white-label)
- Add switching costs (templates, client portals, training)
- Focus on "you get what you pay for" messaging
- Niche down (focus on agencies, not generic PM)
- Emphasize outcomes (time saved) vs. features (file storage)

2. **Transparent:** No hidden fees, usage-based surprises, or "contact sales" for base tiers
3. **Predictable:** Flat monthly pricing by client count, not per-user or per-usage
