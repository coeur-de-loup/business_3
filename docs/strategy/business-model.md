- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:**
  - Focus on vertical depth (industry-specific workflows)
  - Build service moat (implementation, support, templates)
  - Move upmarket (enterprise features, custom integrations)
- **Signal to Monitor:** Zapier/Make launching "AI orchestration" features

**Risk 2: Enterprise Downpricing (Big tech targets SMBs)**
- **Probability:** Low (20%)
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:**
  - Build brand loyalty quickly (switching costs)
  - Focus on "small business" positioning (not "cheaper enterprise")
  - Deep integration with SMB tools (enterprise overlooks)

### Product Risks

**Risk 3: Technical Complexity (Harder to build than expected)**
- **Probability:** Medium (30-40%)
- **Impact:** Medium-High
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start narrow (2-3 integrations, 5-10 templates)
  - Use existing tools (Zapier API, not native integrations initially)
  - Hire experienced AI/ML engineer
- **Signal to Monitor:** Customer complaints about "doesn't work consistently"

**Risk 4: Reliability Issues (AI workflows fail)**
- **Probability:** Medium (40-50%)
- **Impact:** High (trust lost)

  - Error handling and "human in the loop" design
  - Clear communication: "Beta - expect some hiccups"
- **Signal to Monitor:** Churn due to reliability concerns

### Business Model Risks

**Risk 5: High CAC (Customer acquisition too expensive)**
- **Probability:** Medium (30%)
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Content-led growth (organic traffic vs. paid)
  - Product-led growth (referrals, virality)
  - Focus on high-LTV customers (Professional tier)
- **Signal to Monitor:** CAC:LTV ratio dropping below 3:1

**Risk 6: Low Willingness to Pay (Customers won't pay $50-100)**
