**Email 3: Success Story (Day 3)**
Subject: How [Similar Business] saved 15 hours/week

Hi [Name],

I wanted to share a quick story from [Customer Name], who runs a marketing agency like yours:

**Before [Our Platform]:**
- Using 7 different AI tools ($400/month)
- Spending 10 hours/week on manual workflows
- Team struggling with adoption (tools too complex)

**After [Our Platform]:**
- Consolidated to 1 platform ($99/month)
- Automated 20 workflows (saved 15 hours/week)
- Entire team using it (so simple, anyone can use it)

**ROI: $301/month savings + 15 hours/week**

Hi [Name],

You've been using [Our Platform] for a week now. I wanted to check in:

1. **What's working?** Which workflows are you using most?
2. **What's challenging?** Any friction points?
3. **What else can we automate?** Any workflows we don't have yet?

Just hit reply and let me know. I read every response personally.

If you haven't created your first workflow yet, no worries! Here's a 2-minute video to get you unstuck:

If you're not sure, here's what I recommend:

1. **Create 1 more workflow** (pick from our library of 50+ templates)
2. **Invite a team member** (see how easy collaboration is)
3. **Check your ROI** (we'll show you time saved and subscriptions eliminated)

If you decide [Our Platform] isn't for you, no hard feelings. But I'd hate for you to miss out on:

- $300-500/month in subscription savings
- 10+ hours/week in time savings
- Done-with-you onboarding and support
