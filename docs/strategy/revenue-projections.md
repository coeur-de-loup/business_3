## 6. Unit Economics Deep Dive

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**CAC Calculation:**
- Total sales & marketing spend / New customers acquired

**Year 1 CAC:**
- Marketing spend: $50,000 (content, tools, Part-time marketer)
- New customers: 500
- **CAC Year 1: $100/customer**

**Year 2 CAC:**
- Marketing spend: $250,000 (content, paid ads, full-time marketer)
- New customers: 2,000
- **CAC Year 2: $125/customer**

**Year 3 CAC:**
- Marketing spend: $750,000 (content, paid ads, growth marketer)
- New customers: 7,500
- **CAC Year 3: $100/customer**

**Blended CAC (Years 1-3):**
- Total marketing spend: $1,050,000
- Total new customers: 10,000
- **Blended CAC: $105/customer**

**Note:** Our CAC assumption ($250-500) is conservative. Actual CAC may be lower due to content-led growth and product-led virality.

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**LTV Calculation:**
- ARPC × Gross Margin × Customer Lifetime (months)

**Base Case LTV:**
- ARPC: $75/month
- Gross Margin: 60% ($45/month)
- Customer Lifetime: 36 months (3 years at 3% monthly churn)
- **LTV = $75 × 0.60 × 36 = $1,620**

**Optimized LTV (Year 3):**
- ARPC: $90/month (upsells to higher tiers)
- Gross Margin: 70% ($63/month)
- Customer Lifetime: 48 months (4 years at 2% monthly churn)
- **LTV = $90 × 0.70 × 48 = $3,024**

**Average LTV (Years 1-3):** $2,700

### LTV:CAC Ratio

**Year 1:**
- LTV: $1,620
- CAC: $100
- **LTV:CAC: 16.2:1** (excellent - best-in-class)

**Year 2:**
- LTV: $2,100
- CAC: $125
- **LTV:CAC: 16.8:1** (excellent)

**Year 3:**
- LTV: $3,024
- CAC: $100
- **LTV:CAC: 30.2:1** (world-class)

**Average LTV:CAC (Years 1-3):** 5.4:1 to 10.8:1 (based on $250-500 CAC assumption)

**Benchmark:** SaaS companies target 3:1 LTV:CAC. We're well above target.

### CAC Payback Period

**Payback Calculation:**
- CAC / (ARPC × Gross Margin)

**Year 1:**
- CAC: $100
- ARPC × Gross Margin: $75 × 0.60 = $45
- **Payback: 2.2 months** (excellent)

**Year 2:**
- CAC: $125
- ARPC × Gross Margin: $45
- **Payback: 2.8 months** (excellent)

**Year 3:**
- CAC: $100
- ARPC × Gross Margin: $63
- **Payback: 1.6 months** (world-class)

**Target:** <12 months payback. We're at 2-3 months.

### Gross Margin Analysis

**Revenue Per Customer:**
- Starter: $49/month
- Professional: $99/month
- Enterprise: $299/month
- **ARPC: $75/month** (weighted average)

**Variable Costs Per Customer:**
- Hosting/infrastructure: $10/month (average)
- AI API costs: $20/month (average)
- Support costs: $7.50/month (average)
- Payment processing: $2.25/month (Stripe: 3% of $75)
- **Total Variable Costs: $39.25/month**

**Gross Margin:**
- ARPC: $75/month
- Variable Costs: $39.25/month
- **Gross Margin: $35.75/month (48%)**

**Optimization (Year 2-3):**
- Scale hosting costs down to $5/month
- Negotiate API volume discounts to $15/month
- Automate support to $5/month
- **Optimized Variable Costs: $27.25/month**
- **Optimized Gross Margin: $47.75/month (64%)**

**Target Gross Margin:** 60-70% (achievable by Year 2-3)

## 10. Risk Factors & Mitigation

### Revenue Risks

**Risk 1: Slower Customer Acquisition**
- **Impact:** Miss ARR targets, run out of cash
- **Probability:** Medium (30%)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Reduce burn rate (cut hiring, slow marketing spend)
  - Focus on high-LTV customers (Professional/Enterprise tiers)
  - Pivot to vertical focus if horizontal too slow

**Risk 2: Higher Churn Than Expected**
- **Impact:** Lower LTV, worse LTV:CAC, unprofitable
- **Probability:** Medium (30%)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Improve onboarding (reduce time-to-value)
  - Add success team (proactive check-ins)
  - Improve product reliability (fewer bugs)
  - Offer annual contracts (lock in customers)

**Risk 3: Pricing Resistance**
- **Impact:** Lower ARPC, need more customers to hit targets
- **Probability:** Low (20%)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Introduce lower tier ($29/month)
  - Improve value communication (ROI calculator)
  - Add more features to justify price
  - Offer discounts for annual contracts

**Risk 4: Competitor Undercutting**
- **Impact:** Price war, lower margins
- **Probability:** Medium (40%)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Don't match prices (race to bottom)
  - Differentiate on quality and support
  - Add switching costs (templates, workflows)
  - Build brand loyalty quickly

### Cost Risks

**Risk 5: Higher AI API Costs**
- **Impact:** Lower gross margins, reduced profitability
- **Probability:** Medium (30%)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Negotiate volume discounts with OpenAI/Anthropic
  - Optimize workflows (reduce API calls)
  - Pass costs to customers (usage-based overage)
  - Build proprietary AI models (long-term)

**Risk 6: Scaling Costs Higher Than Expected**
- **Impact:** Lower net income, longer path to profitability
- **Probability:** Medium (30%)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Hire slowly (revenue must justify headcount)
  - Automate support (reduce per-customer costs)
  - Use cloud credits (AWS Activate, Google Cloud for Startups)
  - Outsource non-core functions (accounting, HR)
