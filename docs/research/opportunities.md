**Research Date:** January 8, 2025
**Methodology:** Each opportunity scored on market size, competition level, timing readiness, technical feasibility, speed to validation, and revenue potential

## Scoring Framework

### Score Categories (1-10 Scale)
- **Market Size:** TAM/SAM/SOM potential (1 = tiny, 10 = massive)
- **Competition:** How saturated is the market (1 = blue ocean, 10 = red ocean)
- **Timing:** Is the market ready NOW (1 = too early/late, 10 = perfect timing)
- **Feasibility:** Can a small team build this (1 = requires massive resources, 10 = soloable)
- **Validation Speed:** Weeks to prove demand (1 = months/years, 10 = days/weeks)
- **Revenue Potential:** Path to $10k+ MRR (1 = unlikely, 10 = highly probable)

### Weighting Formula
**Overall Score = (Market Size × 25%) + ((10 - Competition) × 25%) + (Timing × 20%) + (Feasibility × 15%) + (Validation Speed × 10%) + (Revenue Potential × 5%)**

*Note: Competition is inverted (10 - score) so lower competition = higher overall score*

**Passing Threshold:** 7.0+ out of 10

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Action (Next 30 Days)

**1. Pick Your Beachhead**
Don't try to evaluate all 10. Choose ONE based on:
- Your expertise/interest
- Your network advantages
- Your risk tolerance
- Your resources (time, money, skills)

**Top 3 for Quick Validation:**
1. **AI Implementation Partner** - Start today, no code needed
2. **AI Tool Consolidation Platform** - Pre-sell with landing page
3. **Micro-SaaS Portfolio** - Launch multiple, see what sticks

**Top 3 for Maximum Impact:**
1. **AI Tool Consolidation Platform** - Largest market, best timing
2. **No-Code AI Workflow Builder** - Platform potential, high leverage
3. **Vertical AI Automation** - Defensible niche, high ARPU

**2. Validate Before Building**
- Create landing page explaining the problem/solution
- Run $500 in targeted ads (Google, LinkedIn, Reddit)
- Collect emails; attempt to pre-sell
- Talk to 20 potential customers (not friends, real prospects)
- Only build if you see genuine purchase intent

**3. Start with Concierge MVP**
Don't build full software initially. Do it manually:
- Automate with scripts/tools
- Provide white-glove service
- Learn the workflow deeply
- THEN build software to scale what works

### Avoid These Common Mistakes

❌ **Building for 6 months before talking to customers**
✅ Talk to customers on Day 1; build in Week 4

❌ **Trying to be "everything AI" to everyone**
✅ Pick a specific problem for a specific customer

❌ **Chasing trends, not problems**
✅ Start with painful problem; AI is just the solution

❌ **Assuming "if you build it, they will come"**
✅ Build audience first; product second (or simultaneously)

❌ **Perfectionism and overbuilding**
✅ Ship MVP; iterate based on feedback
