## Competitive Intensity

**Competition Level:** MODERATE to HIGH

**Existing Categories:**
1. All-in-one agency management (Productive, Function Point, Scoro)
2. Project management (Asana, Monday, ClickUp, Basecamp, Trello)
3. Client feedback tools (BugSmash, marker.io, Pastel, Ruttl)
4. Client portals (Agency Handy, SuiteDash, Moxo, many others)
5. Freelancer tools (Indy, HoneyBook, Bonsai, Taskip)

**Opportunity:**
- Most tools are either:
  - **Too complex** for small agencies (enterprise features, high cost)
  - **Too narrow** (just feedback, just file sharing)
  - **Too expensive** for $50k-$500k businesses
  - **Trying to do everything** (causing the tool fatigue problem)

**White Space:**
- Simple, affordable client portal focused on:
  - File sharing + version control
  - Centralized feedback
  - Basic project status
  - Client communication
- **Not** a full project management system (too complex)
- **Not** enterprise software (too expensive)

## Market Share Analysis

Assuming a $1.7B client portal market:

| Player | Est. Revenue | Market Share |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Zendesk (Guide) | ~$200M | ~12% |
| Salesforce (Customer Portal) | ~$500M | ~29% |
| Monday.com (portion) | ~$100M | ~6% |
| Niche players (all others) | ~$900M | ~53% |

**Note:** The "niche players" segment is highly fragmented with hundreds of smaller tools - this is where we'd compete.

**Our target share of fragmented market:**
- Capture 0.1% of $1.7B = $1.7M ARR (achievable)
- Capture 0.5% of $1.7B = $8.5M ARR (ambitious)

## Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimates

**Assumptions:**
- Average subscription: $30/mo = $360/year
- Churn rate: 8% annually (industry standard for SMB SaaS)
- Average customer lifespan: 12.5 years (1/0.08)

**CLV:** $360 × 12.5 = **$4,500 per customer**

**With growth (upgrades to higher tiers):**
- Assume 20% upgrade to $60/mo after year 2
- CLV increases to **~$6,000**

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Target:**
- Healthy CAC:LTV ratio = 1:3
