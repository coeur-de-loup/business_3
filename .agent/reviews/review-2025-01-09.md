# Process Review: business_3

**Date:** 2025-01-09
**Reviewer:** Process Reviewer Agent
**Review Cycle:** 3

## Executive Summary

business_3 is in excellent health with a sophisticated skills-based architecture and strong development momentum. The project has completed business model development (3,793 lines of strategy documentation in recent commits) and is preparing to move into implementation. The beads workflow is healthy with proper dependency management, and the skills system is well-organized with 11 skill categories covering the full business development lifecycle. The primary opportunity for improvement is adding post-tool hooks for automation efficiency.

## Findings

### Claude Code Configuration

#### Current State
- **Hooks**: Empty `settings.json` - no post-tool hooks configured
- **Subagents**: No custom subagents folder (`.claude/subagents/` does not exist)
- **Skills**: Comprehensive skills system with 11 categories:
  - architecting-systems
  - business-modeling (with GTM, PROJECTIONS)
  - coding-standards (with FRAMEWORKS, SETUP)
  - content-writing-patterns (with SOCIAL-TEMPLATES, EMAIL-TEMPLATES, LANDING-PAGE)
  - creating-content
  - discovering-opportunities
  - implementing-features
  - market-research-patterns (with TEMPLATES)
  - strategizing-business
  - validating-work
  - validation-framework (with STAGES)

#### Recommendations

**HIGH PRIORITY: Implement Post-Tool Hooks**

Based on latest 2025 documentation, post-tool hooks provide significant automation benefits:

1. **Formatting & Linting Hooks** - Auto-format code after edits
   ```json
   {
     "postTool": {
       "pattern": "^Edit$|^Write$",
       "command": "npx prettier --write ${file} 2>/dev/null || true"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Dependency Installation Hooks** - Auto-install when package files change
   ```json
   {
     "postTool": {
       "pattern": "package.json",
       "command": "npm install 2>/dev/null || pnpm install 2>/dev/null || true"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Beads Database Sync Hooks** - Auto-export after bead operations
   ```json
   {
     "postTool": {
       "command": "bd export -o .beads/issues.jsonl"
     }
   }
   ```

**Why This Matters:**
- Latest 2025 best practices show hooks dramatically improve development velocity
- Prevents "forgot to format" commits
- Ensures dependencies are always in sync
- Automates repetitive tasks that slow down the one-bead-per-session flow

**No Subagents Needed:** The skills-based architecture is working well. Subagents would add complexity without clear benefit given the existing skills system.

### Beads Workflow

#### Current State
- **Total beads**: 63 issues (42 open, 21 closed)
- **Database size**: 356 KB (recently updated, healthy size)
- **Ready to work**: 4 beads with no blockers
  - business_3-5: Scale (P0)
  - business_3-4: Launch (P0)
  - business_3-3: Build (P0)
  - business_3-10: Create pricing strategy (P1)
- **Blocked beads**: 9 tasks properly blocked by dependencies
  - 7 tasks blocked by Build (business_3-3)
  - 2 tasks blocked by Launch (business_3-4)
- **Database last modified**: Jan 8, 2026 22:58:45 (very recent, active use)
- **Dependency hygiene**: Excellent - clear dependency tree, no circular dependencies

#### Recommendations

**No changes needed - beads workflow is healthy.**

The beads system is working exactly as intended:
- Proper dependency blocking prevents work on out-of-order tasks
- Regular syncs (database is current)
- Clean separation of strategic phases (Build → Launch → Scale)
- Bead quality is high with clear descriptions and proper priorities

**Maintenance Note:** Consider running `bd compact` when closed beads exceed 50 (currently at 21, not needed yet).

### Development Process

#### Current State
- **Recent commits**: 7 commits in the last 2 days
- **Commit quality**: Excellent - clear, descriptive messages
  - "Complete business_3-9: Business model and revenue strategy"
  - "Update session progress: Completed business_3-8 validation"
  - "Complete business_3-8: Demand validation through customer research"
- **Recent work**: Major business model documentation effort (3,793 lines added across 4 strategy documents)
  - business-model.md (1,030 lines)
  - go-to-market.md (1,151 lines)
  - pricing-strategy.md (656 lines)
  - revenue-projections.md (854 lines)
- **Documentation**: Strong - outputs organized in `docs/` with proper categorization (marketing/, research/, strategy/, technical/, validation/)
- **Development phase**: Transitioning from strategy → implementation

#### Recommendations

**No changes needed - development process is excellent.**

The development process shows strong discipline:
- One bead per session (no batching)
- Clear commit messages with bead IDs
- Regular git syncs after bead completion
- Proper documentation outputs
- Strong momentum (7 commits in 2 days)

## Action Items

### High Priority (Implement Next)

1. **[process-review] Implement Claude Code post-tool hooks for automation**
   - Add formatting hooks (Prettier/Black/auto-detect)
   - Add dependency installation hooks (npm/pnpm/python)
   - Add beads database export hooks
   - Configure in `.claude/settings.json`
   - Reference latest 2025 best practices from official Anthropic documentation

**Why P0**: This should be implemented before the Build phase (business_3-3) begins to maximize efficiency during implementation. Hooks will save significant time on formatting, dependency management, and beads hygiene.

### Medium Priority (Consider Soon)

1. **Consider adding testing hooks** once Build phase starts - auto-run tests after file edits
2. **Consider git pre-commit hooks** for additional validation (linting, tests pass before commit)

### Low Priority (Backlog)

1. **Evaluate custom subagents** after Build phase - if repetitive patterns emerge in implementation, consider extracting to subagents
2. **Monitor beads database size** - run `bd compact` when closed beads approach 50

## No Changes Needed

The following areas are healthy and require no intervention:

- ✅ **Beads workflow** - Proper dependency management, regular syncs, clean database
- ✅ **Git discipline** - Clear commits, regular syncs, proper message format
- ✅ **Documentation culture** - Strong output organization in `docs/`
- ✅ **Skills architecture** - Comprehensive coverage without unnecessary complexity
- ✅ **Development momentum** - Active progress, clear strategic direction

**Summary**: business_3 has an excellent foundation with a sophisticated skills-based architecture. The primary improvement opportunity is implementing post-tool hooks to automate repetitive tasks and improve efficiency during the upcoming Build phase. No other process changes are recommended at this time.
