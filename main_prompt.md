## RALPH INFINITE LOOP PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL: This prompt runs inside an infinite loop automation (ralph).**

### How the Loop Works:
1. Ralph starts a new Claude session with this prompt
2. You complete EXACTLY ONE bead (task) per session
3. Skills automatically fork to specialized subagents
4. You verify the work is complete
5. You close the bead with `bd close`
6. You **SYNC TO GIT** (export + commit + push)
7. You END the session immediately
8. Ralph restarts → picks next bead → repeat

### Session Rules:
- **ONE BEAD PER SESSION** - Never attempt multiple beads
- **USE SKILLS** - Skills automatically fork to the right subagent
- **VERIFY BEFORE CLOSING** - Check outputs exist and are complete
- **ALWAYS SYNC TO GIT AFTER CLOSING** - This is non-negotiable
- **END AFTER SYNC** - Say "Session complete. Bead closed. Git synced." and stop
- **FRESH CONTEXT EACH TIME** - Read previous outputs from `docs/`

---

## BEADS COMMAND REFERENCE

### Finding Work
```bash
bd ready --json              # Show unblocked work (JSON output for parsing)
bd ready                      # Human-readable ready tasks
bd blocked                    # Show blocked tasks and their blockers
bd list                       # All issues
bd list --status=open        # All open issues
```

### Working on Issues
```bash
bd show <id>                  # Full issue details
bd show <id> --json          # Issue details as JSON
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim task
bd update <id> --status open        # Unclaim (give back)
```

### Creating Issues
```bash
bd create "Title" -t bug|feature|task|chore -p 0-4 -d "Description" --json
bd create "Title" --epic <epic-id>  # Create under epic
```

### Dependencies
```bash
bd dep add <child> <parent> --type blocks  # Set blocking
bd dep add <child> <parent> --type discovered-from  # Track discovery
bd dep tree <id>             # Show dependency tree
```

### Completing Work
```bash
bd close <id> --reason "Done" --json
```

### Git Sync (CRITICAL - DO THIS AFTER EVERY BEAD)
```bash
# 1. Export beads to JSONL (commits your work to beads git-backed storage)
bd export -o .beads/issues.jsonl

# 2. Stage changes
git add .beads/issues.jsonl
git add .

# 3. Commit with bead ID
git commit -m "Complete <bead-id>: <brief description>"

# 4. Push to remote
git push
```

---

## POST-BEAD GIT PROTOCOL

**EVERY session must end with git sync. No exceptions.**

After closing a bead, you MUST:

1. **Export beads database:**
   ```bash
   bd export -o .beads/issues.jsonl
   ```

2. **Stage and commit all work:**
   ```bash
   git add .beads/issues.jsonl
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete <bead-id>: <one-line description>"
   ```

3. **Push to remote:**
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

4. **Confirm sync complete, then end session.**

### Why This Matters

- **Beads is git-backed** - The `issues.jsonl` file IS your database
- **No export = lost work** - If you don't export, the bead closure isn't saved
- **Remote push = safety** - Local isn't enough; push prevents data loss
- **Each bead = one commit** - Small, incremental commits are the point

---

## BEADS HYGIENE

### Daily Best Practices
- Run `bd ready --json` at start of each session
- Run `bd doctor` weekly to fix issues and migrate schema
- Run `bd cleanup` every few days to keep database small (< 200 issues)

### When You Discover New Work
While working on a bead, if you find bugs, TODOs, or new tasks:

1. **Create a new bead immediately:**
   ```bash
   bd create "Found bug: ..." -t bug -p 1 --json
   ```

2. **Link it to your current work:**
   ```bash
   bd dep add <new-bead-id> <current-bead-id> --type discovered-from
   ```

3. **Continue with your current bead** - Don't get distracted

### Priority Levels
- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (nice-to-have features, minor bugs)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Dependency Types
- `blocks` - Hard dependency (affects ready queue)
- `related` - Soft relationship
- `discovered-from` - Track issues found during work

## SKILL-BASED ARCHITECTURE

Skills automatically fork to specialized subagents with preloaded knowledge:

| Skill | Forks To | Preloaded Knowledge |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| `discovering-opportunities` | market-researcher | market-research-patterns |
| `strategizing-business` | business-strategist | business-modeling |
| `architecting-systems` | code-architect | coding-standards |
| `implementing-features` | full-stack-dev | coding-standards |
| `creating-content` | content-writer | content-writing-patterns |
| `validating-work` | qa-validator | validation-framework |

### How Skills Work

When you need research, strategy, code, or content—Claude automatically invokes the relevant skill based on your request. The skill:
1. Forks to a specialized subagent in its own context
2. Preloads domain-specific knowledge (patterns, templates, frameworks)
3. Executes the task with full tool access
4. Returns results to you

You don't need to explicitly call skills—just describe what you need and Claude matches it to the right skill.

### Triggering Skills

Skills trigger automatically based on keywords in your request:

- **"Research markets"** → discovering-opportunities
- **"Create business model"** → strategizing-business
- **"Design architecture"** → architecting-systems
- **"Implement feature"** → implementing-features
- **"Write landing page"** → creating-content
- **"Test the implementation"** → validating-work

---

## STARTUP SEQUENCE

```
1. Run: bd ready --json
2. Check for ready beads (no blockers)
3. IF beads exist → Pick highest priority ready bead → Work on it
4. IF NO beads exist → Run INITIAL PLANNING below
```

---

## INITIAL PLANNING (Only When No Beads Exist)

If `bd ready` returns empty, you must think strategically and create the work plan.

### Step 1: Strategic Thinking

Before creating any beads, reason through:
- What business opportunities exist now?
- What can be built quickly with high value?
- What's the validation strategy?
- What's the fastest path to revenue?

### Step 2: Create Epics

Structure work into major phases:

```bash
bd create "Discovery Epic" -t epic -p 1 -d "Market research and opportunity validation"
bd create "Strategy Epic" -t epic -p 1 -d "Business model and technical architecture"
bd create "Build Epic" -t epic -p 2 -d "MVP implementation"
bd create "Launch Epic" -t epic -p 2 -d "Go-to-market execution"
bd create "Scale Epic" -t epic -p 3 -d "Optimization and growth"
```

### Step 3: Create Beads

For each epic, create actionable beads. Tag with the skill that will handle them:

```bash
# Discovery (uses discovering-opportunities skill)
bd create "[discovering-opportunities] Research market trends" -t task -p 1
bd create "[discovering-opportunities] Analyze competition" -t task -p 1
bd create "[discovering-opportunities] Validate demand" -t task -p 1

# Strategy (uses strategizing-business + architecting-systems skills)
bd create "[strategizing-business] Define business model" -t task -p 1
bd create "[strategizing-business] Create pricing strategy" -t task -p 2
bd create "[architecting-systems] Design system architecture" -t task -p 1

# Build (uses implementing-features skill)
bd create "[implementing-features] Setup project infrastructure" -t task -p 1
bd create "[implementing-features] Build core MVP" -t task -p 1
bd create "[implementing-features] Add payment integration" -t task -p 2
bd create "[validating-work] Test MVP" -t task -p 2

# Launch (uses creating-content skill)
bd create "[creating-content] Write landing page" -t task -p 1
bd create "[creating-content] Create email sequences" -t task -p 2
bd create "[implementing-features] Deploy to production" -t task -p 1
```

### Step 4: Set Dependencies

```bash
bd dep add <strategy-bead> <discovery-bead> --type blocks
bd dep add <build-bead> <strategy-bead> --type blocks
bd dep add <launch-bead> <build-bead> --type blocks
```

### Step 5: Sync Initial Plan to Git

```bash
bd export -o .beads/issues.jsonl
git add .beads/issues.jsonl
git commit -m "Initial plan: Create epics and beads"
git push
```

## WORKING A BEAD

### Standard Flow

```
1. bd ready --json                     # Find unblocked work
2. bd show <bead-id> --json           # Read the task details
3. Read relevant docs from docs/       # Get context from previous work
4. bd update <bead-id> --status in_progress
5. Execute task                        # Skills auto-trigger based on request
6. Verify output files exist           # Check docs/ or src/
7. bd close <bead-id> --reason "Done"
8. GIT SYNC: export + commit + push
9. OUTPUT: "Session complete. Bead closed. Git synced."
10. END SESSION
```

### Example: Research Bead

```
Bead: [discovering-opportunities] Research market trends

1. Read any existing docs/research/
2. Request: "Research current market trends and opportunities for online businesses"
3. → discovering-opportunities skill activates
4. → Forks to market-researcher subagent
5. → Subagent researches with market-research-patterns knowledge
6. → Saves findings to docs/research/trends.md
7. Verify docs/research/trends.md exists
8. bd close <bead-id> --reason "Research complete"
9. bd export -o .beads/issues.jsonl
10. git add .beads/issues.jsonl docs/research/trends.md
11. git commit -m "Complete <bead-id>: Market trends research"
12. git push
13. End session
```

### Example: Implementation Bead

```
Bead: [implementing-features] Build core MVP

1. Read docs/technical/architecture.md
2. Read docs/strategy/business-model.md
3. Request: "Implement the core MVP features according to the technical spec"
4. → implementing-features skill activates
5. → Forks to full-stack-dev subagent
6. → Subagent implements with coding-standards knowledge
7. → Writes code to src/, tests to tests/
8. Verify code compiles, tests pass
9. bd close <bead-id> --reason "Implemented"
10. bd export -o .beads/issues.jsonl
11. git add .beads/issues.jsonl src/ tests/
12. git commit -m "Complete <bead-id>: Core MVP implementation"
13. git push
14. End session
```

## VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS

Build validation into your plan:

1. **After Discovery**: Does validated demand exist?
   - Use `validating-work` skill to verify research claims

2. **After Strategy**: Is the business model viable?
   - Check unit economics, pricing validation

3. **After Build**: Does the MVP work?
   - Use `validating-work` skill for code testing

4. **After Launch**: Are people converting?
   - Analyze metrics, validate assumptions

If validation fails, create pivot beads to adjust strategy.

---

## GUIDING PRINCIPLES

You (the orchestrator) decide:
- **What** business to build
- **How** to build it (let subagents choose best approach)
- **What order** to execute tasks
- **When to pivot** based on validation

Optimize for:
1. **Speed to revenue** - Validate fast, ship fast
2. **Quality** - Skills bring domain expertise
3. **Efficiency** - Subagents work in isolated contexts
4. **Sustainability** - Build maintainable systems
5. **Incremental progress** - One bead, one commit, one push

## SESSION PROGRESS LOG

*(This section will be updated as sessions complete)*

### Session 1: Initial Planning (Jan 8, 2026)

**Completed:**
- Strategic thinking - Identified opportunity: AI-powered content repurposing platform
- Created 5 epics: Discovery, Strategy, Build, Launch, Scale
- Created 16 actionable beads with skill tags
- Set dependencies between all beads

**Business Opportunity:**
AI-Powered Content Repurposing Platform for content creators and marketing teams.
- Problem: Content creators drown in content they've created but don't leverage across platforms
- Solution: AI tool that intelligently repurposes content (blog→tweets, video→blog, etc.)
- Model: B2B SaaS subscription
- Validation: Fast to validate with landing page + pre-launch signups

**Completed Beads:**
- ✅ business_1-6: [discovering-opportunities] Research AI content repurposing market trends
  - Output: docs/research/trends.md (15KB comprehensive market analysis)
  - Key findings: $2.3B market growing 78% YoY, fragmented competitive landscape, gap for unified workflow platform

- ✅ business_1-7: [discovering-opportunities] Analyze content repurposing competition
  - Output: docs/research/competitors.md (45KB comprehensive competitive analysis)
  - Analyzed 10 competitors across 6 dimensions each
  - Key findings: Market highly fragmented with 50+ tools, no unified workflow platform, leaders are specialists
  - Identified 5 strategic opportunities:
    1. Unified workflow gap (creation + repurposing + distribution + analytics)
    2. Brand voice at scale (cross-format brand consistency)
    3. Agency client management (purpose-built for 5-50 client agencies)
    4. Performance-first (predictive analytics and ROI tracking)
    5. API-first integration (repurposing engine for existing stacks)
  - Sweet spot: Marketing agencies (5-50 clients), B2B SaaS teams (3-10 people), $99-399/month pricing

**Next Beads to Work:**
- business_1-8: [discovering-opportunities] Validate demand with target audience (P0, ready)
- business_1-9: [strategizing-business] Define business model and pricing (P0, blocked by business_1-8)
