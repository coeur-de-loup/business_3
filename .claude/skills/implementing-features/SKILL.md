# Implementing Features

Delegates code implementation to the full-stack-dev subagent.

## When to Use

- Building new features
- Implementing technical specifications
- Setting up project infrastructure
- Fixing bugs
- Writing tests

## Expected Outputs

- Source code in `src/` (or framework-appropriate location)
- Tests alongside source or in `tests/`
- Updated documentation in `docs/technical/`

## Quality Criteria

Code must meet these gates:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Linter passes with no errors
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Documentation updated if API changed
