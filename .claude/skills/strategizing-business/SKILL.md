## When to Use

- Designing business models
- Creating pricing strategies
- Building revenue projections
- Planning go-to-market strategy
- Defining customer segments

## Expected Outputs

Strategic documents saved to `docs/strategy/`:
- `business-model.md` - Full business model canvas
- `pricing-strategy.md` - Pricing tiers with rationale
- `revenue-projections.md` - Conservative/moderate/aggressive scenarios
- `go-to-market.md` - Launch and growth strategy
- `customer-avatar.md` - Target customer profiles

## Quality Criteria

Strategy must include:
- Grounded projections based on market data
- Explicit assumptions documented
- Sensitivity analysis for key variables
- Sustainable long-term thinking, not just launch tactics
