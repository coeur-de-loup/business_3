# Business Modeling

## Business Model Canvas

Address each component:

1. **Value Proposition**: What problem do we solve better than alternatives?
2. **Customer Segments**: Who pays and why? Be specific.
3. **Channels**: How do we reach customers cost-effectively?
4. **Revenue Streams**: How do we capture value?
5. **Key Resources**: What must we have to deliver?
6. **Key Activities**: What must we do well?
7. **Key Partnerships**: Who helps us succeed?
8. **Cost Structure**: What are our major costs?

## Pricing Frameworks

### Value-Based Pricing
1. Calculate customer's current cost of problem
2. Estimate value of solution to them
3. Price at 10-20% of value delivered

### Competitive Pricing
1. Map competitor prices
2. Position based on differentiation
3. Justify premium or discount

### Tier Structure
```
Free     → Lead generation, viral growth
Basic    → Core value, solo users ($X/mo)
Pro      → Power users, teams ($Y/mo)
Enterprise → Custom, high-touch (negotiated)
```

## Revenue Projection Model

See [PROJECTIONS.md](PROJECTIONS.md) for detailed financial modeling.

## Unit Economics

Calculate and validate:
- **CAC**: Customer Acquisition Cost
- **LTV**: Lifetime Value (LTV > 3x CAC to be viable)
- **Payback Period**: Months to recover CAC
- **Churn**: Monthly/annual customer loss rate

## Go-To-Market Phases

See [GTM.md](GTM.md) for launch strategy frameworks.
