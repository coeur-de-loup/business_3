# Revenue Projection Framework

## Three Scenario Model

Always project three scenarios:

### Conservative (60% confidence)
- Slower customer acquisition
- Higher churn assumptions
- Minimal viral growth
- Delayed feature adoption

### Moderate (80% confidence)
- Expected acquisition rates
- Industry-average churn
- Some organic growth
- Normal feature adoption

### Aggressive (40% confidence)
- Fast acquisition with paid growth
- Lower than average churn
- Strong viral coefficients
- Rapid feature adoption

## Projection Template

```markdown
# Revenue Projections: [Business Name]

## Assumptions
- Starting customers: X
- Monthly growth rate: Y%
- Average revenue per user: $Z
- Monthly churn: W%

## Month-by-Month (Year 1)

| Month | Customers | MRR | Churn | Net New | Cumulative |
|-------|-----------|-----|-------|---------|------------|
| 1 | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | |
...
| 12 | | | | | |

## Milestones
- $1K MRR: Month X
- $5K MRR: Month Y
- $10K MRR: Month Z

## Key Sensitivities
- If churn +1%: Revenue impact -X%
- If price +10%: Revenue impact +Y% (assuming Z% conversion drop)
- If acquisition -20%: Revenue impact -W%
```

## Validation Checkpoints

After each milestone, validate:
1. Are assumptions holding?
2. What's actual vs projected?
3. Should we adjust the model?
4. Do we need to pivot?
