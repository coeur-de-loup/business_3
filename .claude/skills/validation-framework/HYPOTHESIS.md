## Common Hypothesis Types

### Problem Hypothesis
"[Target audience] has [problem] that is [severity]."

**Test with:**
- Forum/social research (are people complaining?)
- Survey responses
- Interview insights
- Search volume for solutions

### Solution Hypothesis
"[Our solution] will solve [problem] better than [alternatives]."

**Test with:**
- Landing page conversion
- Waitlist signups
- User testing feedback
- Prototype reactions

### Pricing Hypothesis
"[Target audience] will pay $[X] for [solution]."

**Test with:**
- Price sensitivity surveys
- A/B testing on landing page
- Early sales/pre-orders
- Competitive comparison

### Channel Hypothesis
"We can acquire customers through [channel] at $[CAC]."

**Test with:**
- Small ad budget tests
- Content performance
- Outreach response rates
- Referral program results

## Validation Evidence Sources

### Strong Evidence
- Actual purchases/payments
- Signed letters of intent
- Waitlist with credit card
- Repeated usage

### Moderate Evidence
- Email signups with engagement
- Survey responses (validated sample)
- Prototype user testing
- Competitor customer complaints

### Weak Evidence
- Social media likes/shares
- "Sounds interesting" feedback
- Unvalidated survey responses
- Assumptions from analogies

## Avoiding Validation Pitfalls

1. **Confirmation bias**: Actively seek disconfirming evidence
2. **Vanity metrics**: Focus on actionable metrics only
3. **Friend feedback**: Friends are not your target market
4. **Small samples**: Ensure statistical significance
5. **Leading questions**: Use neutral framing in research
