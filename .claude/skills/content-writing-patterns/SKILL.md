# Content Writing Patterns

## Core Principles

- **Benefit over feature**: "Save 10 hours/week" not "Automated scheduling"
- **Specific over vague**: "Join 2,847 marketers" not "Join thousands"
- **Active over passive**: "Get started in 2 minutes" not "Getting started takes 2 minutes"
- **Short sentences**: Break up complexity. One idea per sentence.

## Landing Page Structure

```
1. HEADLINE - Hook with primary benefit
2. SUBHEAD - Clarify the value and audience
3. PROBLEM - Agitate the pain they feel
4. SOLUTION - Present your offering
5. FEATURES → BENEFITS - What they get and why it matters
6. SOCIAL PROOF - Testimonials, logos, numbers
7. FAQ - Address objections
8. CTA - Clear next step
```

See [LANDING-PAGE.md](LANDING-PAGE.md) for detailed copy frameworks.

## Email Sequences

### Welcome Sequence (5 emails)
1. Welcome + quick win
2. Your story + mission
3. Case study / proof
4. Feature highlight
5. Soft CTA

### Onboarding Sequence (7 emails)
1. Getting started
2. First milestone
3. Common mistakes
4. Power features
5. Success story
6. Check-in
7. Next level
